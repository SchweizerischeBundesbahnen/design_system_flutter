[Design System Mobile](https://designsystems.app.sbb.ch/) in Flutter (yes, it could be that easy...).

This framework contains SBB (Swiss Federal Railways) UI elements for Flutter Apps. It allows an easy integration of SBB theming to your app (or a custom color theming of your choice). All elements are optimized for dynamic TextSizes, VoiceOver, light & dark mode as well as for different SizeClasses.

*Note:* This plugin is still under development and some APIs might change. Feedback and Pull Requests are most welcome!

## Usage
---
To use this plugin, add `design_system_flutter` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/). As this is a private plugin, you must add it as a Git dependency:
```yaml
dependencies:
  design_system_flutter:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/SchweizerischeBundesbahnen/design_system_flutter.git
```
## Getting Started
---
### Dart/Flutter Integration
From your Dart code, you need to import the plugin and instantiate it:
```Dart
import 'package:design_system_flutter/design_system_flutter.dart';
```

After that simply use the provided fonts, styles, colors, widgets...
